# Scout-Serverside
Transferred from [Scout-Serverside](https://github.com/dnguyen130/Scout-Serverside) repository for heroku deploy, which contains contributions from other group members

Application utilizing Express.js, Node.js and MongoDB that handles all serverside interactions and CRUD for Scout

## quik notes
- move api to backend so that can use axios default base URL?
- animes collection will only be used to transfer to filter to client side?
- yourlist will be linked to user
- formidable for user card? or react save png library

password validation, populate yourlist instead and use refs, get rid of secrets and use diff mongo url
more things in user schema

figure out how to get all animes instead of just 20
